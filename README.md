Matlab implementation of the dimensional operators defined in (1,2), acting on simplicial complexes.

Also includes more operators and code to read/write images.

Important: This code only works for images, that are transformed into a regular simplicial complex of dimension 3.

An implementation considering a more generic structure is more dependent on the used data structure and should be straightforward from the definitions.

While written in matlab, the code can be easily used as base to another languages.
